An API wrapper for OWM One Call API, usable in node and the browser. It pairs best when used in a TypeScript project, as you will get all the types from the API response. This library makes interacting with the OpenWeatherMap "One Call" API a little bit more friendly. It offers promises, request customization, and best of all response types.

If there are any features you would like, please feel free to open up an issue.

## Motivation

I am also the author of [DarkSky API Client](https://github.com/worldturtlemedia/darksky-api), and I was saddened when I heard that [DarkSky API](https://blog.darksky.net/) annouced it was being shut down after being acquired from Apple.

There was not really an similar "one-call" experience, so it looks like [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) saw an opportunity and took it. For right now this library will **only** support the "one-call" API. There are plenty other libraries on NPM that cover the rest of the APIs.

**Again**: This will _only_ support the one-call API (for now).

### Notes

- I did my best to correctly add types for all of the supported endpoints. However if you notice an incorrect payload type, or some missing properties, please open up an issue, or submit a pull request.
- For use in the browser, you will need a CORS proxy.

## Features

- This library is powered by [tsdx](https://tsdx.io/), and outputs ~~UMD~~, CommonJS, and an ESM bundle.
- Supports OpenWeatherMap's new "one-call" API
  - Similar to what DarkSky's API was.
- Tree-shakeable! Keep those bundles small.
- Tested
- Generated library documentation
- Easy integration into an existing codebase that uses [DarkSky](https://github.com/worldturtlemedia/darksky-api/edit/master/DARKSKY.md).

## TODO

- Add ability to pass in a CORS anywhere proxy

## Installation

```bash
yarn add onecall-api

# or

npm install onecall-api
```

## Getting started

You will need to obtain a API token from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/price).

The free tier does give you access to the "one-call" endpoint. A subscription is now required when using the OneCall API. If you receive a 401 when getting the forecast that is the reason. You must subscibe to their new pricing model.

## Usage

Create an account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api), then get your API token.

There are a couple ways to use this library.

### DarkSky Compatibility

For integrating this library with an existing codebase that used to use DarkSky, please see the [DarkSky - Compat](https://github.com/worldturtlemedia/darksky-api/edit/master/DARKSKY.md) document.

### TimeMachine request

Any request can be made into a TimeMachine request by passing `{ time: 'some-timestamp' }` into any function that accepts an optional `params` object.

The `time` property an be any of the following:

- Date object.
- A valid formatted date-string.
- UNIX timestamp.

Either be a UNIX timestamp or a string formatted as follows:

```typescript
// UNIX timestamp
{
  time: 1558575452
}

// Date string
// [YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]T[HH]:[MM]:[SS][timezone].
{
  time: "2019-01-01T00:00:00+0400"
}
```

The library will try it's best to parse the Date string you pass in, so you don't _need_ to supply it in the above format. But for safety its probably best.

> Timezone should either be omitted (to refer to local time for the location being requested),
> `Z` (referring to GMT time), or +[HH][mm] or -[HH][mm] for an offset from GMT
> in hours and minutes.

## 1. OpenWeatherMapClient class

Get instance of the factory.

Use any of the OpenWeatherMapClient helper functions (see below).

```typescript
// Optional Default options
const options: OpenWeatherMapOptions = {
  // Optional
  // Anything set here can be overriden when making the request

  units: Units.Metric,
  lang: Language.FRENCH,
}

// Create the api wrapper class
const openWeatherMap = new OpenWeatherMap(KEY, options)

// Use the wrapper

/**
 * Will get the weekly forecast using a helper function, it excludes all of the datablocks except
 * for the `daily` one.  If you need more than that you can use `DarkSky.forecast` and pass in
 * an Exclude array.
 */
async function getWeeklyForecast(
  lat: number,
  lon: number
): Promise<WeekForecast> {
  try {
    // You can pass options here to override the options set above
    const result: WeekForecast = await openWeatherMap.week(lat, lon, {
      lang: Language.ENGLISH,
    })
    console.log(`Got forecast for ${result.lat}-${result.lon}`)
    return result
  } catch (error) {
    // If OpenWeatherMap API doesn't return a 'daily' data-block, then this function will throw
    console.log("Unable to get the weekly forecast for the chosen location")
  }
}

;(async () => {
  const forecast = await getWeeklyForecast(42, 24)

  console.log(`Forecast for tomorrow: ${forecast.daily.temp.max}`)
})()
```

## 2. Chaining

You can build a request by using method chaining and a builder pattern.

```typescript
// Using helper function
import { buildOpenWeatherMapRequest } from "darksky-api"

buildOpenWeatherMapRequest("api-key", 42, 24)
  .extendHourly()
  .onlyHourly()
  .execute()
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.log)

// Using the DarkSky class
new OpenWeatherMap("api-key")
  .builder(42, 24)
  .time("May 05 2019") // Library will try it's best to parse this date string
  .units(Units.UK)
  .execute()
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.log)
```

## 3. Manual OpenWeatherMap client

This library also exports a minimal OpenWeatherMap wrapper, where you can manually create the requests.

```typescript
import { openWeatherMapClient } from "owm-onecall-api"

const targetDate = new Date(1558000000 * 1000)

openWeatherMapClient("api-key")
  .timeMachine({ lat: 42, lon: 24, time: targetDate }, { units: Units.Metric })
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.log)
```

## OpenWeatherMap class helper methods

Optional settings when creating a new wrapper:

```typescript
export interface OpenWeatherMapOptions {
  /**
   * Return weather conditions in the requested units.
   */
  units?: Units

  /**
   * Return summary properties in the desired language.
   *
   * @default Language.ENGLISH
   */
  lang?: Language

  /**
   * Exclude some number of data blocks from the API response.
   */
  exclude?: Exclude[]

  /**
   * Optional config to change the way axios makes the request.
   */
  requestConfig?: AxiosRequestConfig
}
```

All helper methods require the location `lat: number, lon: number`, and can take an optional settings object.

If you need the forecast for a specific date and time, you can use OpenWeathMaps's TimeMachine functionality by passing a `time` property to each helper function, example:

```typescript
new OpenWeatherMap("api-key").week(42, 24, { time: "May 5 2018" })
```

## Demo

A demo is available in the `demo/` folder, in order to run follow these steps:

1. Get an API key from OWM
1. Make sure you are subscribed to their pricing plan
1. Run the following commands:

```sh
yarn build
node demo --key <INSERT API KEY>
```

You can change the default latitude and longitude by passing `--lat` and `--lon`.
